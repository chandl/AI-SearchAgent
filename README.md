# Artificial Intelligence: Excercise 3A: SearchAgent

## Assignment
Implement an agent that solves problems in the MÃ†DEN simulated environment.
(Maeden is a simulated grid-world environment designed to support multi-agent problem-solving.
Agent controllers may be written in any language that supports basic sockets.)

Agent can have internal state and can use search to find paths to locations in the environment.

## About

This client is an intelligent agent that uses a combination of 'mental maps' and A* seach to nagivate mazes.

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm for more information about A* search. 

This project was built for CS 455 - Artificial Intelligence, at Southern Oregon University - Winter, 2017 (Professor Wayne Iba).

## Running the Program

In order to run the program correctly, the Maeden
program must be running before starting the agent.

When the world has been chosen and loaded into Maeden
the agent can be started. 

This is done by navigating to
the src folder and opening a command window in the location.

Type in: `java MaedenClient` and the program will run.
