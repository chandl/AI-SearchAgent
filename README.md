# Artificial Intelligence: Excercise 3A: SearchAgent

## Assignment
Implement an agent that solves problems in the MÃ†DEN simulated environment.
(Maeden is a simulated grid-world environment designed to support multi-agent problem-solving.
Agent controllers may be written in any language that supports basic sockets.)

Agent can have internal state and can use search to find paths to locations in the environment.
